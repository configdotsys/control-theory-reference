# Control Theory Notes and References

This repository contains selected technical reference notes compiled as a working reference for control systems concepts.

The material is not intended to be a tutorial, textbook, or original theoretical contribution. Instead, it consolidates standard equations, interpretations, and mental models used when analyzing and implementing control systems.

Notes are organized for clarity and long-term reuse alongside modeling, simulation, and embedded control projects.

#### Disclaimer

This repository contains personal engineering notes and reference material
compiled for self-study and long-term technical review.

Some concepts, formulations, and figures are based on standard control
and electrical engineering textbooks and academic sources. All original
commentary, organization, and synthesis are my own.

If any material here raises copyright concerns, please contact me and I
will promptly remove or replace it.
